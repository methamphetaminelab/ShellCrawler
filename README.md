# ShellCrawler
ShellCrawler is a text-based roguelike game played entirely in the terminal. Explore dark dungeons, battle monsters, and collect artifacts as you navigate through ASCII symbols in a retro command-line adventure. Each move brings new dangers and treasuresâ€”where every command could mean survival or doom!
